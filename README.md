# Intro to Coding Bootcamp 2025
## Coding Outreach Group (COG)

This set of tutorials is intended for complete beginners to coding. If you have never written a line of code in your life, these tutorials will help you get comfortable coding in two popular programming languages: R and Python. These two languages are often used by psychology researchers, and these tutorials are catered to that field. However, the concepts covered are applicable in any field that does coding. Much of the material covered in the tutorials is borrowed from some already great, and more in-depth tutorials. A list of these is available [here](https://github.com/TU-Coding-Outreach-Group/Tutorials/blob/master/index.md).

## Getting Started
Each tutorial will list the necessary prerequisites in their respective README.md files, but here is some software we recommend you install before the workshops.
