## Description
This workshop will be an introduction to Python. In this tutorial, you will create a Python script using the Spyder software.

Similar to the R workshop, this workshop will focus on developing a complete data analysis pipeline that you can use to conduct your own independent research. As part of the pipeline, we will focus on reading in data, cleaning data, conducting statistical analyses, and visualizing data.

By the end of this workshop series, our hope is that you will feel comfortable enough to work independently in Python!
