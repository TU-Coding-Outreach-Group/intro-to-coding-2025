## Description
This workshop will provide an introduction to the programming language commonly referred to as R! 

R is a popular programming language that many researchers use for organizing data, visualizing data, and carrying out statistical analyses.

By the end of this workshop series, our hope is that you will feel comfortable enough to work independently in R!.

## To-do before the tutorial
1. Download R  
         Windows: https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/R-4.2.1-win.exe
